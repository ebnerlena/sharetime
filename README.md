## Social Networking App

1. Started working in Android Studio using Constraint layouts and view binding  
Using intents to achieve different actions like starting a second activity, sharing some text or viewing my Website.  

2. Using Fragments instead of Activities - Fragments get exchange in one mainactivity
Navigation haben with supportFragmentmanager - transactions

3. Navcontroller - using the NavController NavGraph for navigation between fragments 
and pass typesafe arguments through navigation

4. Recyclerview - ListAdapter -> to display lists in linear layout or grid
